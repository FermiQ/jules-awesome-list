# Documentation for pull_request_template.md

## Overview

The `pull_request_template.md` file, located in the root directory of the repository, provides a basic template to guide contributors when they create pull requests. Its main purpose is to ensure that pull requests include a consistent description and a self-verification checklist, helping to streamline the review process.

## File Location Note

This template is located in the repository's root directory. For GitHub to automatically populate the pull request description field with this template, it should typically be placed in the `.github/` directory (e.g., as `.github/pull_request_template.md`). In its current location, contributors would need to manually copy and paste its content.

## Key Components

The template consists of the following sections:

*   **Description**:
    *   Heading: `### Description`
    *   Instructional text: "Please provide a brief description of your addition or change." This prompts the contributor to explain what their pull request is about.
*   **Checklist**:
    *   Heading: `### Checklist`
    *   A list of items that contributors should verify before submitting:
        *   `[ ] I've added the prompt in the correct section.`
        *   `[ ] The prompt is helpful, concise, and clear.`
        *   `[ ] I've double-checked the markdown formatting.`

## Important Variables/Constants (Placeholders & Instructions)

The template uses the following placeholders and instructional elements:

*   The instruction under "Description": `"Please provide a brief description of your addition or change."`
*   The checklist items are interactive placeholders:
    *   `[ ]` (empty square brackets) are intended to be marked as `[x]` by the contributor to indicate completion or verification of each point.

## Usage Examples

A contributor is expected to use this template as follows:

1.  **Locate the template**: Find the `pull_request_template.md` file in the root directory.
2.  **Copy Content**: Copy the entire content of the template.
3.  **Initiate Pull Request**: When creating a new pull request on GitHub.
4.  **Paste Content**: Paste the copied template into the pull request description field.
5.  **Fill Description**: Replace the instructional text under "Description" with a specific summary of their changes.
6.  **Complete Checklist**: Review each item in the "Checklist" and mark the checkboxes (e.g., changing `[ ]` to `[x]`) to confirm they have been addressed.
7.  **Submit Pull Request**: Submit the pull request with the completed template.

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **GitHub Pull Request Interface**: The content is designed for use in the GitHub pull request submission form. Due to its location, this usage is manual.
*   **Contributors**: The effectiveness of this template relies on contributors being aware of its existence and choosing to use it.
*   **`contributing.md`**: Ideally, the `contributing.md` file should reference this template and instruct contributors on its use, especially given its non-standard location.
*   **Repository Maintainers**: Maintainers will use the information provided in the filled-out template to understand and review the pull request.

This template helps maintain a level of consistency and completeness in pull request submissions, even if its current placement requires manual effort from contributors.
